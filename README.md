# Spring Boot Application

This project demonstrates a **Spring Boot** application developed using **Maven**. It covers various Spring concepts, including Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and database integration.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Java 17+** (or any compatible Java version): You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).
- **Spring Tool Suite (STS)**: This project is developed using Spring Tool Suite (STS), which you can download from the [official website](https://spring.io/tools).
- **Maven**: Make sure Maven is installed on your machine. You can download Maven from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- **MySQL** (or any other relational database): Install MySQL from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the Spring Boot application up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JAVA-PRACTICE.git
cd JAVA-PRACTICE
```

### 2. Configure the Database (MySQL)

If your Spring Boot application requires a database, such as MySQL, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure MySQL is installed and running.**
2. **Create a database** (e.g., `my_database`):

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE my_database;
   ```

3. **Configure the database connection** in the `application.properties` file (located in `src/main/resources`):

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

   Replace `localhost`, `my_database`, `root`, and `yourpassword` with your actual database details.

### 3. Open the Project in Spring Tool Suite (STS)

1. Launch **Spring Tool Suite** (STS).
2. Open your project by selecting **File** > **Import** > **Existing Maven Projects** and browsing to your cloned project directory.

### 4. Run the Application

You can run your Spring Boot application directly from **Spring Tool Suite (STS)**:

1. In STS, locate the **main application class** containing the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation (usually named `Application.java` or similar).
2. Right-click on the **Application.java** class and select **Run As** > **Spring Boot App**.

Alternatively, you can use the **Run** button (green play icon) in STS if you have configured the run configurations.

Once the application starts, you can access it at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality using Spring Data JPA.
- **Database Integration**: Integration with MySQL for data persistence.
- **RESTful APIs**: Exposes REST APIs for resource management.

### Customization Notes:
- Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/JAVA-PRACTICE.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
- Update the **database connection details** in the `application.properties` section to match your actual configuration.
- Modify the "Features" section if you have additional functionality or features in your application.
